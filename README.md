# BeFit - Building Education Foundations Through Innovation and Technology

This is my final project for the ALXSE program Cohort-16. This project was inspired by an on-going project that is being implemented by the Ministry of Education in Malawi. 

The Project is about enhancing primary school students from standard 1-4 in literacy and numeracy skills. The project is using the OneBillion software lessons. Thus where my project came about, well in this project I want to create a web-app where the onebillion software lessons should be inclusive to all learners even those living with disabilities. Therefore, i want to have a small pop video on all lessons of someone translating the content in sign language. 

That's my dream for inclusiveness in education!!!

BeFit ~ _inclusoveness for All !!!__
